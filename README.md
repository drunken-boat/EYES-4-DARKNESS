## 1. Intro
This is a project in memory of a Chinese peot, 顾城(Gu Cheng), which is named after his most known peom:

>***黑夜给了我黑色的眼睛***
>***我却用它寻找光明***
>***(Dark night endowed me with eyes for darkness,***
>***yet with them I seek light)***

## Note

I declare NO interest to his love affarir, relationship, and homicide! It is his poems, and poems only that make me nostalgic and mourn his in this way.
